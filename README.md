## Description
Calorie Tracker
The Calorie Tracker project is designed to help users monitor and manage their daily calorie intake. It consists of a Python program utilizing a mymeal class to represent different meals and their respective calorie values. The program allows users to input personal details such as weight, height, age, and gender, and calculates the total daily calorie requirement based on the Harris-Benedict equation.

Features:
Personal Details Input: Users can enter their weight, height, age, and gender to personalize the calorie calculation.

Meal Logging: The program uses the mymeal class to log details of different meals, including their names and calorie values.

Calorie Update: Users can update the calorie value for a specific meal using the mugure_calorise method.

Total Calories: The program calculates and displays the total daily calorie intake based on the user's personal details.

Instructions:
Run the program and provide your weight, height, age, and gender when prompted.
Input details for each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) to track their calorie values.
Optionally, update the calorie value for a specific meal using the mugure_calorise method.
View the total daily calorie intake and the details of logged meals.
